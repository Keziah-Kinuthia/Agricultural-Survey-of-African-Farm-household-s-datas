# Agricultural-Survey-of-African-Farm-household-s-datas
## Introduction
This project analyzes the Agricultural Survey of African Farm Households dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides insights into the characteristics of over 9,500 households across eleven African countries, capturing details about household members including gender, age, marital status, education, involvement in farm and non-farm activities, farm entity type, household size, and geographic information.

## Project Overview
This project involves the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**: Loading the dataset and inspecting its structure.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating and presenting descriptive statistics for key variables.
3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Identifying and handling inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers.
4. **Probability & Mathematical Modelling**: Calculating the probability of a household having at least one member engaged in both farm and non-farm activities, and estimating the expected number of such households in a sample.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations for key variables to provide clear insights.
